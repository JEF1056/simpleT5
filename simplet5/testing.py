It also helps with browning, tenderizing, and adding moisture to the strawberry bread.Milk  I recommend using whole milk for the best flavor. Milk also adds sweetness and a creamy texture to the bread. Youll also need milk for the glaze as it adds more flavor than water.Oil  adding vegetable oil to the batter adds a ton of moisture to the bread, improves the crumb structure, and keeps the crumb soft.Baking powder  make sure your baking powder has not expired, so your bread gets a nice lift.Strawberries  pick the reddest and juiciest strawberries you can find. Strawberries stop ripening once theyve been picked, so the reddest ones will give you the sweetest results.How to Make Strawberry Bread1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla. In another medium bowl, stir together 2 cups of flour, baking powder, and salt.2. In a small bowl, combine strawberries and 2 tablespoons flour, tossing to coat strawberries.3. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture and stir until just combined.4. Fold the strawberries into the batter.5. Pour the batter into a prepared 95-inch loaf pan. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes and let cool completely on a wire rack.6. Place the strawberries in a small bowl and mash them.7. Stir in the powdered sugar and milk.8. Spoon over the cooled bread. Let stand for 30 minutes or until the glaze sets before serving.Pro Tips for Making This RecipeDepending on how juicy the strawberries are, you may need to increase the powdered sugar or just omit the milk. The glaze should be thick.Do not skip tossing the strawberries in flour. The flour will make sure the strawberries dont sink to the bottom of the loaf pan. You can also save a few strawberries to sprinkle on the top of the batter in the pan.Avoid opening the oven door to check on the bread while it bakes. If you open the oven, the cool air from the kitchen will rush in, and you risk the middle of the bread collapsing.Avoid overmixing the batter, as itll make the strawberry bread tough and chewy.Use a scale to measure your flour. This will yield the most accurate results. However, if you dont have a scale, fluff your flour with a spoon and then spoon it into your cups before leveling it off with a knife. This method is the best way to measure flour without overpacking the measuring cup, leading to a heavy loaf.Did you run out of strawberries to make the glaze?
